# Running DGEMM with GPUs

You can find here a version of dgemm from [ELPA tutorial](https://github.com/karpov-peter/elpa-tutorial/) which runs on single GPU.

1. Build the code with provided [build.sh](build.sh) script. Run the code with
   different matrix sizes, how does the performance compare to the CPU version?
